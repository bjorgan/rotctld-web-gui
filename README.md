# Basic Rotctld Web GUI
Mark Jessop 2018-07-07

This repository contains a very basic rotctld control web interface, targeted for use on a mobile browser.
I wrote this out of a need to have an easy way to test a new az/el rotator while on a roof, with the controller down in my radio shack.


## Dependencies
* Python Modules: flask, flask-socketio  (can obtain using pip)

## Usage:
* Start rotctld (refer rotctld documentation)
* `python rotatorgui.py`
* Navigate to http://localhost:5001/   (or equivalent IP)
